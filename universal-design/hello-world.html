                <p>Johnson performs under the stage name Alyssa Edwards. She chose her name in homage to Alyssa Milano and to her drag mother Laken Edwards, a former</p>
                <p>drag queen. Edwards is part of the drag family "the Haus of Edwards," and serves as drag mother to fellow RuPaul's Drag Race contestants</p>
                <p>Shangela Laquifa Wadley, Laganja Estranja, Gia Gunn, Vivienne Pinay, and Plastique Tiara. Edwards was one of the judges of the 2010 California</p>
                <p>Entertainer of the Year pageant, where Shangela won.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Edwards appeared in the 2008 documentary Pageant. The film focused on the 34th Miss Gay America pageant of 2006. On December 9, 2010,</p>
                <p>Edwards was stripped of her 2010 Miss Gay America title for having business dealings in conflict with obligations to the Miss Gay America organization.</p>
                <p>First alternate Coco Montrese replaced Edwards as the winner of Miss Gay America. That same year, Edwards was also stripped of her title as All</p>
                <p>American Goddess.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In November 2012, Logo announced that Edwards was among 14 drag queens who would be competing on the fifth season of RuPaul's Drag Race. Also</p>
                <p>performing on the show was pageant friend and rival Coco Montrese.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Edwards performed and won in the ballet-themed main challenge in the "Black Swan: Why It Gotta Be Black?" episode of Rupaul's Drag Race. As part of the show, Edwards sang on the "We Are the</p>
                <p>World"-inspired song "Can I Get an Amen?" The song's proceeds helped benefit the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center. Edwards was eliminated in episode nine, following a lip sync against Coco</p>
                <p>Montrese, and finished in sixth place. Edwards has also been a special guest on the podcast series run by RuPaul and Michelle Visage called RuPaul: What's The Tee?</p>
                <br>
                <p>She was one of thirty drag queens featured in Miley Cyrus's 2015 VMA performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Edwards is also known for her web series titled "Alyssa's Secret". The series stars Alyssa Edwards speaking on a multitude of subjects and often features guests including other members of the Haus</p>
                <p>of Edwards. The webseries is produced and premieres through World of Wonder Productions</p>
